# nba_gamethread_bot

A reddit bot written in python to automate the posting of gamethreads on reddit.com/r/nba

Not currently in use, I want to see if there's a better way of writing it to collect live scores but fully functional as of now.

May be broken due to oAuth in PRAW but that's planned for later.
